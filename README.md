This is our very first project in Adalab.
Three weeks ago we did not know what a HTML file was and today we are glad to show you our first webpage.

We have been working to reach a milestone every week.

- First week:

  >  We spent the first two days organizing how to work. For this we used Trello, following the Agile methodology Kanban, so it is been easier to distribute the work and to know in which section should work each member. We decided where to do each part: at home on our own or everybody together in the classroom. We started to create our HTML and CSS during class hours to be able to ask questions to our teacher. Meanwhile, we did the content of our project at home.

- Second week:

  >  We started to work on the structure of HTML and CSS the first week, but we didn't put together everything until the second week. Each member did a specific section: header, hero and first part of the main, second part of the main and footer. The milestone of the second week was to create the mobile version of the project and at the end of the week it was done. We created the repository on GitHub to work together and to follow the changes in a easier way.

- Third week:

  >  We coded the responsive version for tablet (768px) and desktop (1200px). In order to comprehend how the whole page worked, we divided the sections among us diferently this time. We also created the formulary page and made it responsive.

- Fourth week:

  >  We implemented SASS in our project and we started to work with Gulp. We changed our CSS file and split it into partial files. Also, we added variables and mixes. During this week, we worked more closely using GitHub and fixing issues. We added a section displayed with grid.

- Fifth week:
  > We did a couple of animations in the header of our project and we added some effects with Hover in the links of the footer. We spent most of the time preparing the presentation with Prezi and preparing it to be ready to present it in front of our public.
