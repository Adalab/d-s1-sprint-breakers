# Adalab Sprint 1 Project
## "Spring Breakers team"

This is our first project in Adalab.
One week ago we didn't know what a html file was and today we are glad to show you our first webpage.

We've been working to reach a milestone every week.

- First week:

    We spent the first two days organizing how to work. We are working on Trello, following the Agile methodology Kanban, so it's been easier to distribute the work and to know in which section is working each member. We decided where to do each part: at home on our own or everybody together. We started to create our HTML and CSS during the class hours to be able to ask the questions. On the other hand, we did the content of our project at home.

- Second week:

    We started to work on the structure of HTML and CSS the first week, but we didn't put together everything until the second week. Each member did a specific section: the header, the hero and the first part of the main, the second part of the main and the footer. The milestone of the second week was to create the mobile version of the project and at the end of the week it was done. We created the repository on GitHub to work together and to follow the changes in a easy way.

- Third week:

    We did the responsive version for tablet (768px) and desktop (1200px). As we work in the mobile section we have divided the work in four parts, working each one in a different section with the aim of learning how it works the entire page. We created the formulary of contact to all of the devices.

- Fourth week:

    We have implemented SASS in our project and we have started to work with Gulp. We have been changing our CSS document and doing the division in partials. Also, we have added variables and mixes. During this week, we have been working more closely using GitHub and fixing issues.

-Fifth week:
